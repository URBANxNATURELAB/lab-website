# Capital Area UWIN

We are fortunate to work closely with colleagues across 25 cities through a multi-city urban biodiversity monitoring network called the Urban Wildlife Information Network (UWIN). We run a long-term array of study sites across the Washington, D.C. region. Together with other UWIN partners we have amassed the worldâ€™s largest urban wildlife dataset. This network and study design is not taxa specific and facilitates long-term cross-institution collaborations. Datasets at this temporal and spatial scale allow us to study a diverse set of novel and challenging urban ecology topics, such as metapopulation and metacommunity dynamics, human-wildlife interactions, and habitat connectivity.
