We are a conservation science and quantitative ecology lab in the [Department of Environmental Science and Technology](https://enst.umd.edu/){target="_blank"} at the [University of Maryland](https://umd.edu/){target="_blank"}. **Our lab envisions cities where nature and people thrive together.** Our mission is to undertake scientific research that supports ecological and conservation-minded urban design, planning, and policy. We use theories and principles in ecology and conservation science to provide evidence-based solutions that simultaneously conserve biological diversity and improve the lives of urban residents.
