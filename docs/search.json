Understanding how species adapt to these urban environments is an important endeavors to enhance coexistence and conserve species. In an effort to understand how species adapt to urban environments, we are assessing boldness and exploratory behaviors in urban coyotes and raccoons using a novel object study design. The information generated from this project will inform management decisions pertaining to human-wildlife coexistence.\n\n\n\n",

However, urban ecosystems have unique characteristic compared to their more rural counterparts. Therefore, ecological theories and principles derived from more natural ecosystems may not be generalizable in urban environments. Through our research we hope to better understand fundamental ecological processes in urban ecosystems (e.g., species distribution functioning, species-habitat relationships, and population and community dynamics). In this space we work on applied projects such as metacommunity and metapopulation dynamics, scale dependent species-habitat relationships, novel fear and risk dynamics, and spatial planning and prioritization of green infrastructure in cities.\n\n\n\n",

Examples include crop pollination by bees, air purification and cooling by urban trees, space to engage in physical activity, or pleasure that we get from birdwatching in our neighborhood park. But who gets to benifit from these services? Is the spatial distribution of ecoystem services, and thus access to these services, equal and just? We are particularly interested in how ecosystem services are distributed across cities. Our current project is looking at the spatial distribution of ecosystem services provided by public street trees in Washington, D.C.\n\n\n\n",

Travis works to understand how urban\nenvironments shape species distributions, populations, communities, and\nbehaviors. The goal of his research is to provide evidence-based\nsolutions that simultaneously conserve biological diversity and improve\nthe lives of urban residents.\nGraduate Students\n\nKrista Shires, Ph.D.Â Student\nI am a PhD student in Environmental Science and Policy with a\nbackground in Psychology. My previous experiences as a veterinary\ntechnician, animal control officer, and zoo keeper-aide have all\ninfluenced my research. I am interested in the impact of urbanization on\nwildlife, specifically, how human interference alters predator-prey\ndynamics, stress, and behavioral patterns of local species. I am\ninterested in utilizing citizen science to answer broader questions\nabout landscape ecology and serve as a method of public education with\nthe aim of fostering a connection between people and nature.\n\n\nMerri Collins, Ph.D.Â Student\nI am a graduate student in the Environmental Science and Policy\nProgram at George Mason. I have worked with a variety of species in past\npositions as a wildlife conservation biologist, everything from\nherpetofauna to marine mammals. I am interested in human/wildlife\nconflict mitigation, understanding drivers of local habitat and species\nlosses, and how we can reduce these through practical application and\nmanagement. At Mason I will be starting the National Capitalâ€™s first\nlarge-scale, and long-term urban wildlife monitoring project.\n\n\nDan Herrera, Ph.D.Â Student\nDanâ€™s personal\nwebsite\nI am a graduate student in Environmental Science and Policy at George\nMason University. My research experience has broadly focused on animal\nbehavior and urban ecology. During the winter of 2017 and summer of\n2018, I worked with Dr.Â Gallo at the Urban Wildlife Institute in\nChicago, IL. I have since moved to Washington, DC, to survey the\nCapitolâ€™s wildlife through a collaboration between the Humane Rescue\nAlliance and the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute. I am\nthrilled to continue working with Dr.Â Gallo as we use these data to\nbetter understand wildlife response to urbanization on a fine scale. I\nam interested in dynamic interactions between the anthropogenic and\nnatural landscapes that influence urban wildlife, and the resulting\npotential human-wildlife conflict.\n\n\nKay Pontarelli, M.S. Student\nIâ€™m a M.S graduate student in the Environmental Science and Policy\nProgram at George Mason University (GMU), with a concentration in\nConservation Science and Policy. My interests are within animal ecology\nin urbanized areas. My love for wildlife came from growing up as a\nmilitary brat overseas with each transition presenting new habitats to\nexplore. At GMU Iâ€™m studying insect community composition in residential\nyards to see how neighborhoods could provide beneficial habitat for\ninsects. This would, in turn, affect nearby flora and fauna that depend\non insects as food, pollinators, pest control, and decomposers, and\ndecrease fragmentation caused by urbanization.\n\n\nHannah Wood, M.S. Student\nI am currently pursuing a Masterâ€™s degree in environmental science\nwith a concentration in conservation science and policy through the ESP\nAccelerated Masterâ€™s program. I have always been passionate about\nwildlife and taking care of the world around us. My research\ninvestigates behavior change of urban mammals using a field-based novel\nobject study in the Washington, D.C. metro.\nUndergraduate Students\n\nFaith Kruger, Research\nAssistant\nI am an undergraduate student majoring in Environmental Science with\na concentration in wildlife. I have always been passionate about natural\nsciences and wildlife and love how this major combines both. I hope to\nbe involved in the field of wildlife conservation and look forward to\ngaining research experience.\n\n\nTristan Silva-Montoya,\nResearch Assistant\nIâ€™m an undergraduate student here at George Mason studying\nEnvironmental Science. I plan to concentrate in Wildlife, specifically\nherpetology. I have a strong passion for all wildlife that started when\nI was young and would go camping with my parents. Since that passion\nstarted Iâ€™ve always had pets in the house starting from geckos and\nturtles to chameleons and monitors along with the dogs of course.\nGrowing up around a lot of animals really makes you curious about the\nintelligence and personality of those animals, hence my future goal of\nworking in wildlife conservation or beneficial captive facilities used\nfor breeding and awareness. I am more than excited for the opportunity\nof gaining experience and working towards something bigger than\nmyself.\n\n\nAlix Upchurch, Research\nAssistant\nI am an undergraduate student in the Honors College at George Mason\nUniversity majoring in biology and minoring in conservation. I plan to\ngo to veterinary school and study to become a wildlife veterinarian and\npractice conservation medicine. I have always been interested in\nwildlife and protecting them and their habitat. I look forward to the\nexperience I will gain here at the URBANxNATURE lab.\nLab Alumni\nGraduate Students:\nAngela Gaal - M.S. Student (2019-2021).

I am committed to creating a classroom climate that promotes and supports inclusivity. For example, I invite guest lecturers that represent the diversity of the student body, as well as design the course content and delivery to consider studentsâ€™ backgrounds and areas of interests. Providing diverse role models at the classroom podium and within lecture materials engages students and reinforces the idea that they too can become part of the next generation of leaders â€“ regardless of race, ethnicity, ability, socioeconomic status, gender identity, or sexual orientation.\nEqual â€“ Feeling safe and welcome in the classroom leads to academic success. I create a classroom and lab environment that is built on collaboration and not competition. Students are encouraged to work together to solve problems and think critically. I aim to create a productive learning environment where, regardless of backgrounds and identities, students feel equal and respected.\nEngaging â€“ Feeling safe, welcome, and represented is my cornerstone to successful interaction with students. However, to encourage meaningful engagement with course content, I also incorporate readings from primary and popular literature to guide and stimulate discussion. Independent or group projects grounded in local ecosystems can also compliment learning in the classroom. As an urban ecologist, this approach is particularly well suited for more urban universities. Conducting projects in urban environments increases student knowledge about the natural world in which they spend their everyday lives, and promotes understanding and appreciation for the ecology of and in cities.\nClasses that Travis Teaches:\nApplied Ecology: Fall and Spring semesters\nConservation Biology: Fall and Spring semesters in odd years (2021, 2023, 2025)\nPrinciples of Wildlife Ecology: Spring semester in even years (2022, 2024, 2026)\n#rstats for Natural and Social Sciences: Fall semester in even years (2022, 2024, 2026)\n\n\n\n",

And in highly heterogeneous and dynamic ecosystems like cities, scale may play an even bigger role in ecological processes. We take a landscape ecology approach to most of our research questions, asking at what scale should conservation actions occur? For example, do animal and plant communities differ across a city or between neighborhoods. Do they even differ between front yards and backyards? Do animals select habitat at varying scales, and which scale is most important for habitat management and conservation? Conservation actions may be ill-informed and miss their mark if they do not account for species-specific scale dependencies. Therefore, understanding the scale at which species respond to the environment is critical for urban reconciliation.\n\n\n\n",
